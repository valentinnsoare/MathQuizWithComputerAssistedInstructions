# :man_technologist: MathQuiz  
## _With Computer Assisted Instructions_

<br>

:arrow_right: A game of math questions with ✨**Java 17**✨ were we can register players. Now we need to select a player
and then we choose a level of questions difficulty (this means what type of numbers we will have with the questions, 1 or 2 digits).

:arrow_right: After the level of difficulty players will select what type of questions they want, multiplication, addition, division or subtraction.
From which type they will choose, a number of points will be set and added to player scorecard in case a player gave a correct answer.

:arrow_right: In the game menu we have multiple options, to add a player, change current player, change difficulty, print help, print rankings, choose question and many more.
